Welcome to the DESI MWS data Model!
===================================

The DESI MWS data Tree
----------------------

This hosts the description of the data products for stars in
DESI from the RVSpecfit and FERRE pipelines. This description
is based on the data from the DR1 data release.

The outputs from two pipelines are given separately with the
exception of of the main mwsall table that combines the outputs
from the two pipelines in one file, as well as identifies
duplicates observed in different surveys and programs.
