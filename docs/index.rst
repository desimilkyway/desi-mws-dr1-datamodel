This page hosts the description of the Milky Way Survey Value added

This catalogues is based on the ouput from the from the RVSpecfit and FERRE pipelines.

The outputs from two pipelines are given separately with the
exception of the main mwsall table that combines the outputs
from the two pipelines in one file, as well as identifies
duplicates observed in different surveys and programs.
